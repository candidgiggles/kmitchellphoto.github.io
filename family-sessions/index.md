## Family Sessions

Family Lifestyle Sessions are 60 minute sessions held at the location of your choice where I will capture a mixture of portraits and candid shots of individuals or families together. Throughout the session I will be sure to capture various poses and personalities. These sessions are designed for a maximum of up to 6 subjects, however more people can be included for an additional cost. Prints and products are sold a la carte so that you can order exactly what you need to decorate your home or gift away.

The session fee is $225, which covers the photographer's time and talent, pre-session consulting, post editing, order fulfillment and include 20 digital images. Additional prints and products can be purchased. 

If your photos will be used professionally (brand promo, blog/website, social media, modeling portfolio, linkedin, etc), please refer to [headshot and brand photography sessions](http://candidgiggles.com/branding-sessions/).
