WHAT IS THE SESSION FEE?

The Session Fee covers the photographer's time and talent, pre-session consulting, post-editing, portrait presentation, design consulting, and order fulfillment. It does not include any prints or digital files. Click here for a full print and product price list.

WHAT SHOULD WE WEAR?

I love to see families dressed in lots of textures and layers. Not fancy, not formal, not stiff – but something that you can feel comfortable and great when you wear. Accessories including scarves, hats, rain boots, umbrella, and kids costume that they love to be in are great, too.

For family and group shots, coordinating without overly matching is important. You could choose a different shade or hue that are complementary to each other. Also try not to mix the style of clothing, i.e. daddy wears a tie and suit jacket while the son wears a t-shirt and jeans.

Take a look at my [pinterest board](https://www.pinterest.com/kmitchell825/clothing-inspiration-for-photo-sessions/) for outfit suggestions and inspiration. 

WHERE SHOULD OUR SESSION TAKE PLACE? 

I have many favorite parks in the south suburbs that I can recommend. You can take advantage of staying in your home and use a nearby park, backyard or your living room for your session. The goal is to capture the most wonderful memory of you and your family, not a great landscape anyway. It really helps if you go through our website and learn what setting attracts you the most and we can definitely discuss it when we book your session.

WHAT SHOULD WE BRING OR PREPARE FOR THE SESSION?

Whatever means a lot to you and you want to photograph with is a must. From a hand me down blanket, family treasure, bottled water, snacks, favorite toys, and all the necessary stuff to make your kids nice and comfy. Sometimes, parents get creative and add a huge lollipop that is as big as a child’s face or rainbow color balloons to their session to bring the happiest smiles out. We can certainly have a pre-session consultation to discuss any props that you want to use. I am all about making your session fun and happy!

High school seniors are welcome to bring their cap & gowns and a change of clothes if they wish. Also they are encouraged to bring any sports equiment, musical instruments, letter jackets, or other high school memorabilia to show off their accomplishments from the year. 

DO YOU OFFER ANY MINI SESSIONS?

[newsletter](http://mad.ly/signups/88580/join) or on my [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/CandidGiggles). Mini sessions are great to get quick updates of your growing child at a significantly low investment.

HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO VIEW OUR IMAGES AFTER THE SESSION?

Up to 2 weeks. I use an online ordering system that allows you to easily customize your image order from the comfort of own home with an extended ordering period of 14 days to ensure that you are able to make the best choice in planning your image displays. Whether you are planning to accent your walls or shelves with prints, display a coffee table book or keep digital files for archiving- this experience is simplicity at its best!
 
HOW MANY IMAGES WILL I SEE FROM MY SESSION?

You will view at least 15 images for a mini-session and at least 20 images for a Family Session. Event photos will range from 75-150 photos depending on the event.

DO YOU HAVE A  REFERRAL PROGRAM?

Yes! I not only very appreciate my clients’ word of mouth referrals to friends, I also graciously thank my clients for sharing their positive experiences. When you tell your friends about us and they book a session, you will automatically receive 20% off of your next session towards the session fees or products.
