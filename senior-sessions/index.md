Senior sessions are designed for high school seniors who want to show off their achievements with high-quality imagery. I will assist in choosing a location, planning outfits, designing your image displays, and customizing your ordering session. If you need graduation invitations, announcements, or thank you cards, a package can be customized to fit your needs. Ideally this session would take place the summer before the student’s senior year, however it can be scheduled at any time. 

High school seniors are welcome to bring their cap & gowns and a change of clothes if they wish. Also they are encouraged to bring any sports equiment, musical instruments, letter jackets, or other high school memorabilia to show off their accomplishments from the year.
