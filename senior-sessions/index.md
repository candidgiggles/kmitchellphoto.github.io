Senior sessions are designed for high school or college seniors who want to show off their achievements with high-quality imagery. I will assist in choosing a location, planning outfits, designing your image displays, and customizing your ordering session. If you need graduation invitations, announcements, or thank you cards, a package can be customized to fit your needs. Ideally this session would take place the summer before the studentâ€™s senior year, however it can be scheduled at any time. 

Seniors are welcome to bring their cap & gowns and a change of clothes if they wish. Also they are encouraged to bring any sports equiment, musical instruments, letter jackets, or other high school memorabilia to show off their accomplishments from the year.

### Senior Session
$250 for a one hour session at the location of your choice and include 20 digital images. Additional prints and products can be purchased. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/2p0cfsj45ai802c/2019PricingSheet.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">Click here</a> for the full price list.
