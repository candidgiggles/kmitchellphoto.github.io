##  A special package for 8th graders and High School Seniors

Let me do the shutter snapping while you enjoy your son or daughter’s most memorable events of the school year. A “memory year book” is perfect for busy parents who want to save time, receive high quality images, and be captured in the memory as well. After the final event or session, we will bind all those memories together in a beautiful album that withstands everyday browsing.  Gift prints can be ordered a la carte for friends and family. 

The “memory year book” is a 20 page book printed on professional lustre photo paper with binding that allows every page to lay flat. Your photos will be displayed beautifully with rich vibrant colors that will last a lifetime.

##  Investment: $850

($1050 value)

Includes:

- Five hours of photography, which can be divided among multiple events 
- One 20 page 8x8 custom designed photo book 
- A shareable mobile app of selected photos
- Private online gallery for purchasing prints a la carte 
					
Additional hours will be billed at $125/hour. A 50% deposit is required at booking.
