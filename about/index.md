Hi, I’m Kimberly - a wife, mother of two, lawyer by profession, photographer by passion, and the woman behind the lens at K. Mitchell Photography (formerly known as Candid Giggles Photography). My artistic eye and technical skills allow me to create beautiful images of life’s everyday moments- images for you to share, display, and pass down to future generations. Over the last few years I have proudly displayed my photographs at competitions and exhibitions, including the Museum of Science and Industry Black Creativity Juried Art Exhibition and the Beverly Arts Center Art Competition & Exhibition, where one of my pieces received the Bill and Judie Anderson Award. 

I am dedicated to clients who desire to document the fun, natural, and extraordinary moments in their lives. My loyal and satisfied customers say that I’m lighthearted, relaxed, and confident, which pretty much sums up my personality. One of my goals is to facilitate a successful, stress-free photography experience for you and your loved ones. After making you feel comfortable in front of the camera and capturing your special time, I will convert those memories into art for your home. So contact me. We’ll plan your session, have a great time, and you’ll love your photographs!

Email me at <a href="mailto:kimberly@candidgiggles.com">kimberly@candidgiggles.com</a> if you have any questions about booking a session.
